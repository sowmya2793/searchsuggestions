###1. How long did you spend on the coding test? 
What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 
If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

Time spent for test- 12hrs
I would probably host it ( CORS specifications doesnt allow access to local files to fetch from http/https)
I have included a workaround but it is not secure to keep credentials in js file.



###2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? 
Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

The latest and most useful features added to ECMA 2021 that could be used for this example are
String replaceAll
Promise.any
Logical assignment operators (&&=) OR & Equals (||=) Coalescing & Equals (??=)


###3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?


Yes Before Prod,
1. Image optimization
2. minification of files(html,js, css/less)
3. Preload only certain scripts to avoid loading time for some features.
In prod, 
1. Timeline tool in the Chrome Developer Tool to monitor load time of assests and test performance
2. Test for dangling variables/ prevent loss of data.


###4. How would you improve the innosabi APIs that you just used?
Although I have been unable to completely use this API, I would be interested to learn more about it and figure out a better way to arrive at a solution.
